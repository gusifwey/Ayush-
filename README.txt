AYUSH ❤️ RISHITA — HOW TO RUN

1) Open this folder and double-click 'index.html' to open in your browser.
2) That's it! Everything works offline.
3) (Optional) Put your favorite song file in this same folder and name it 'music.mp3'.
4) To add more 'Reasons', open 'index.html' in any editor and search for: const reasons = [ ... ]
   Add or edit lines inside the array (aim for 100). Save the file and refresh the browser.
5) Want to change the photo? Replace 'rishita.jpg' with any photo (keep the same file name).

— Deployment (share as a link)
• GitHub Pages: create a repo → upload these files → Settings → Pages → set 'Deploy from a branch' (main) → Save.
• Vercel/Netlify: create an account → new site → drag-and-drop this folder → it gives you a public link.
